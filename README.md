# Compact LIDAR

In an industrial view of Commercial Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) equipment is
expensive and heavily built. So, the application of an embedded spatial measurement system
using time-of-flight sensor will serve less priced and compact designed system for individuals
who would like to explore and navigate indoor spaces. This embedded spatial measurement
system will acquire data from the time-of-flight sensor, transmit acquired data with the
microcontroller and communicate with pc to analyze data and also design the map of the space
which was measured by the time-of-flight sensor.
